# Dotfiles

## Overview

This is my own dotfiles. If you're interested, please try this out :)

## Installation

I made this to work on Arch Linux.

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your computer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mtaku3/dotfiles ~/Documents/dotfiles/
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything

```bash
stow */
```

or just select what you want (i.e. bash)

```bash
stow bash
```
